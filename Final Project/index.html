          This tutorial teaches you how to add flash storage to your 5th generation iPod classic. While the process is
          relatively beginner friendly, you could possibly damage or even brick the functionality of your iPod. Only
          continue to the tutorial if you accept risks that come with modding your hardware!

        This iPod Classic modding tutorial will walk you through iFixits guide on installing flash storage while
        maintaining a classic apple aesthetic. The following tutorial replaces the HDD in your iPod with an upgradeable
        flash card of your choosing. You may also use this tutorial as a guide to replace the HDD instead of adding
        flash storage if you want to stay true to the original hardwear! Before you begin make sure you are equipped
        with the following tools to start your iPod modding journey: plastic pry tool, needle nose tweezers, flash
        storage card/replacement HDD.

    <div class="image-text-split">

          Before opening your iPod, ensure that the hold switch is in the locked position. The slider should be all
          the way to the right if your iPod is facing you, screen-side down. Free the first retainer clip on the bottom
          of the iPod using the iPod opening tool. The tool's edge should point towards the metal back case to prevent
          scratching the plastic front.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Step2 -->
  <div class="box4 step-box" id="step2">
    <h2 class="box3-caption">Step 2</h2>
    <div class="image-text-split">

          Insert the iPod opening tool into the left side of the iPod, with the edge of the tool pointing towards the
          metal back. Gently enlarge the existing crevice by wiggling the iPod opening tool and moving it to the left.
          Continue doing so until the entire side of the iPod is loose. You can then insert an iPod opening tool to the
          right of the Hold button. Be very careful while inserting the tool, as the display is very fragile.
        </p>
      </div>

  <!-- Step3 -->
  <div class="box5 step-box" id="step3">
    <h2 class="box3-caption">Step 3</h2>
    <div class="image-text-split">

      <div class="right-text">
        <p>
          Gently glide the iPod opening tool on the top of the display, making sure to free the retaining clips. The
          other sides of the iPod should now easily come loose. If they do not, use iPod opening tools on the right side
          of the iPod in the same way as on the left side of the iPod. Separate the front of the iPod from the back
          about an inch (or a couple of centimeters).

          Use angled tweezers or an iPod opening tool to slide up the brown connector latch, holding the orange battery
          ribbon cable in place. Make sure you pull from both sides of the latch. You only need to lift the brown
          connector latch up about 1-2mm to free the cable. Do not lift more or remove the latch, or you might pull the
          white connector with it! You should now have one orange ribbon cable still attaching the front case to the
          back. At this point you are able to remove and replace the blue rubber bumpers, or continue with separating
          the case.

          With the iPod opening tool, gently lift the brown tab of the headphone ribbon cable connector. The tab will
          rotate up 90 degrees, releasing the ribbon cable. Using your fingers, pull out the headphone jack ribbon
          cable. The front and back of the iPod should now be completely separated.
        </p>
      </div>

  <!-- Step6 -->
  <div class="box6 step-box" id="step6">

          Use a small iPod opening tool to release the black hinge holding the hard drive ribbon cable. The tab will
          rotate up 90 degrees towards the logic board, releasing the ribbon cable. Use your forefinger to hold the
          ribbon cable in place; disconnect the drive from the ribbon cable. Connect your flash storage device where the
          HDD ribbon cable once was. Reassemble and restore with iTunes. Your iPod is now flash modded!
