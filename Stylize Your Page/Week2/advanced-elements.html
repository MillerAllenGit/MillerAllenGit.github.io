    >Miller Allen: Prompted thoughts on different essays </header>

    <section class="description" id="about">
      <h1>About</h1>
      Throughout my time in AME 130, I have engaged with various pieces of literature that challenged my perspectives and deepened my understanding of interactive media. This document compiles my thoughts on these works, structured around prompts given by my professor. Each section includes the original prompt followed by my response, where I analyze and reflect on the literature. Links to the readings are provided at the bottom of the page.    </section>
    
    <section class="description" id="On Frank Lloyd Wright">
      <h1>On Frank Lloyd Wright</h1>
      <h2>      "Choose one manifesto and reflect on the words, meaning and intention of the author(s)."--              </h2>

      Frank Lloyd Wright addresses a stagnation he felt in the world of architecture, firmly stating his belief that the buildings being created (at the time he wrote this manifesto) were "economic crimes.” Wright thought architecture had stagnated because of a disconnect from life and culture. Wright then introduces the idea of “organic architecture,” and aligns its principals to that of Jesus or the Tao, in the sense that organic architecture prioritizes and revolves around human nature and beauty. A lot of what Frank Lloyd Wright wrote in this manifesto feels like a warning to architects of the inhuman nature of new ideals and technologies at one point even calling the twentieth century “culturally confused” and “backward”. Wright is not opposed to the  use of new technology (he even talks about the new applications of steel later in the text) he merely advocates for the use of new technologies that brings forth human wellbeing. 

      I interpret the meaning of Frank Lloyd Wright’s In the Nature of Materials to be a guide into the state of mind behind the intrinsic value of human centered design. Wright takes us on a journey through material and integrities that he believes are crucial to the fostering of new meaningful architecture. Frank Lloyd Wright calls for architects to use their heart in the creation process and to utilize new techniques in materials in a way that brings forth progress and enriches human life. The text puts me into a frame of mind that is similar to that of designers focused on human centered design. While Frank Lloyd Wright does not explicitly talk about the processes behind human centered design, he guides the reader into the philosophy behind it. 
      
      As previously stated, I believe In the Nature of Materials to be Frank Lloyd Wright’s message to all architects, reminding them to proceed with caution when moving into new eras of society and culture. Wright shares five new materials or integrities that he believes to be essential in the creation of better architecture. While his writing may seem abstract Frank Lloyd Wright does not keep anything from the reader, which hammers home the pure informative intention of the writing.     </section>

    <section class="description" id="On Design and the Elastic Mind">
      <h1>On Design and the Elastic Mind</h1>
      <h2>"In Design and the Elastic Mind" Antonelli states that one of design’s most fundamental tasks is to help people deal with change.
        Speculate on an area, topic, condition, desire that currently  is in need of change, and how might you as a designer address it?"</h2>

        An area that currently is in need of a redesign (and hopefully I'm not taking the easy way out by saying this) is social media. We are currently bombarded with the future through social media, and struggle to actually learn about the functions and applications of modern technology (something I admire about the text were the designers' human focused goals of explaining complex topics with design, “Without a visual design translation, many fundamental concepts—such as the scope of the human genome or its comparison with that of other primates—would remain ungraspable by most” (Paola 3)). We can see a thousand memes about AI (and some that are generated by AI) and still not learn the real applications for it. 
        A possible solution to the many major flaws in social media is to take a human approach to designing a new algorithm for social media. Currently the social media algorithm, designed to recommend you pictures and videos, has one goal: engagement time. If we fundamentally redesign the algorithm basing its principles on informing and uniting humans (instead of sucking us in and then blasting us with information) I know it would alleviate much of the fear and stress currently felt by many, surrounding rapid change.
